<p>Public Archaeology is the presentation of archaeological research or data in an open, public space that is typically geared toward a community of people or society in general. From books and websites to museum exhibits and heritage sites, Public Archaeology exists in a variety of forms.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the point?</h3>

<p>Public Archaeology has three main components:
  <ul>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Preservation</strong>
      <p>Public Archaeology often brings attention to culturally or historically significant sites in order to raise awareness and encourage preservation. Public Archaeology allows archaeologists to reach a broad audience and encourage opportunities for the public to participate in preservation, whether through donations or simply visiting and promoting the site.</p><li>
     
      <strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Just as Public Archaeology is utilized for preservation, education is also an influential concern when designing and presenting archaeological information to the public. Whether implemented for preservation or simply for contribution to societyâ€™s knowledge, education is a central dimension of Public Archaeology.</p>

      <li><strong>Engagement</strong>
      <p>While education and preservation are two key aspects of Public Archaeology, it is only through engagement that either of these goals can be accomplished. In addition, by allowing the material to speak for itself and engage the public without any specific goal of education or preservation, people are able to explore and interact with the site in their own unique ways and draw new conclusions that may have been missed if the site was designed with a narrow, specific objective.</li>

      <p>Overall, the distinctions between these three components often become blurred when exploring Public Archaeology, but it is important to acknowledge the role each has in shaping the design, presentation, and reception of the data.</p>
